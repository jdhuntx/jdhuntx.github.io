Welcome! My name is Jon, and I am a software engineer living just outside of Boulder, Colorado. I am originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, but during the summer of 2018 my family and I were ready for a change and moved to Colorful Colorado! I've been very fortunate to be successful in a career I have loved for over 20 years - software engineering.

Although I am very lucky to be working in a career that I have been passionate about, I also prize my life outside of work here in Colorado. I am an avid runner, as I have completed 13 marathons across 9 different states during my quest to complete a marathon in all 50 states. Admittedly, I tend to be competitive during my races - so it may take me awhile to compete the 50 states journey since the body can only take so many marathons in a year when running at competitive speeds. I don't neglect other distances, as I like to run the annual community mile race, and one day I may just attempt an ultra-marathon (trail running in Colorado is divine!). I also really enjoy cycling, hiking, and climbing <a href="https://www.14ers.com/">Colorado 14ers</a>.
