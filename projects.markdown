<p>
I consider myself very fortunate that I have had a rewarding and enjoyable career for over 20 years in the software industry. Not every project or job has been great fun or a fulfilling experience, but I feel I have learned something in almost everything I've worked on throughout my career. My career has transitioned from consulting for clients big and small, to working as a full time employee for big Fortune 500 companies and small start-up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> companies. After many years of working in the Microsoft stack, in 2015 I began to work with more "open source" languages and frameworks such as Java and Spring, Scala, Go, Python, and React. In addition to becoming much more of a polyglot engineer, these last few years I have really developed my cloud skills - starting to develop solutions in AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes. Admittedly, when I am working in a language and am able to design and architect interesting software solutions, I really do enjoy the languages and frameworks that I am working in at the time. I believe strongly that delivering on commitments and providing valuable software to customers is the best thing we can do as software engineers, even when we engineers famously have our own preferences.

Member of a 3-person development team that developed an online order management system for a media/advertising company. This system utilized web services written in VB.NET to authorize users against Windows 2003 Server, then proceeded to use other web services to correspond with an internal order management system. A customer could place an order and look up the order status with this new web application. The customer placed the order either by entering the data into a web form, or by uploading an XML file with the order information. I was the presentation-tier developer and designer, using VB.NET to create the ASP.NET pages targeting Internet Explorer and Netscape on the PC and the Macintosh.
